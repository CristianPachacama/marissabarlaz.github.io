![This is me!](/img/MRI2.JPG)

I am a graduate student in the Linguistics department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests include articulatory and acoustic phonetics and phonology.

I am currently working on projects related to modeling the relationship between articulation and acoustics using real-time magnetic resonance imaging. These projects include (1) articulatory-to-acoustic inversion using midsagittal images of the vocal tract and (2) statistical modeling of aperture shown in various slices of the vocal tract compared with denoised acoustic data recorded in the MR scanner. I study phenomena including nasalization in French and pharyngealization in Arabic.

My dissertation explores the relationship between acoustics and articulation in Brazilian Portuguese nasal vowels. Specifically, I am studying the phonetic structure of phonemic nasal vowels and phonetically nasalized vowels in comparison with oral vowels, to determine the phonological status of nasalization in Brazilian Portuguese.
